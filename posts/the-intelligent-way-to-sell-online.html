                            You have spent months picking the right business for your small enterprise. You are now
                            ready to launch. Up till now, your marketing has been by word-of-mouth. To anyone who will listen,
                            you tell your tale and ask for a sale. But you know you need to reach beyond confines of your
                            neighbourhood to really succeed. Having only a small budget you think of going online. The
                            internet offers much lower barriers to finding and converting potential customers than
                            traditional print and broadcast media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An important question at this point for many entrepreneurs is whether to invest in one’s own
                            website or connect and convert on someone else’s. The lure to choose the shortcut is great
                            with social networking services like Facebook and Instagram being popular choices. It costs more
                            to build a website than to sign-up for a Facebook account. It certainly helps that there are
                            <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/972927/number-of-facebook-users-nigeria/" target="_blank">over 20 million Nigerians on Facebook.</a>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why you Need a Website</h2>
                        <figure class="post-image"><img srcset="../images/web-design-thumb.jpg 150w, ../images/web-design-medium.jpg 300w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 300px, 150px" src="../images/web-design-thumb.jpg" alt="Person sketching out a website on paper" /><figcaption>Planning for a website</figcaption></figure>
                        <p>
                            The case for investing in a website is stronger than you may think. The trick is to think
                            about your <span class="underline-em">return on investment</span> (ROI) over time. If done right, your website becomes a marketing
                            system that gives and keeps on giving in the form of an endless stream of referrals and
                            repeat sales.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your website is your real estate on the web, and like a physical building your equity grows
                            with your site’s development and maintenance. You build your website block by block with content
                            that your target audience cares about, while positioning yourself as the trustworthy, likeable
                            expert with the right solution to their problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you may have realised by now, this only works for entrepreneurs who strongly care about
                            their customers. <span class="italic-em">You can’t fake the commitment required to create and sustain the value that
                            delights your customers.</span>

                        <h3>Telling Your Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            You know your craft well. You know your target audience, their goals and their pains. You
                            also have a quality solution that meets your audience’s needs. Now it is time to tell your story
                            in a way that resonates with your audience.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How to use Social Media</h2>
                        <p>
                            Social media sites are where you go to spread the word about your offerings and attract prospects to your website.
                            Unlike on your website, social media sites impose restrictions on the content and format of your posts.
                            Twitter allows no more than <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters" target="_blank">280 characters per Tweet.</a>
                            Facebook has monetisation rules that cover the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/262834734651607" target="_blank">originality of your business content.</a> These
                            restrictions are one more reason you should have a website that you control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Business owners often complain about how hard it is to communicate their product and service
                            offerings to their target audience on social media. Unclear communication results in mismatched
                            expectations, delays in order fulfilment and increased operational costs. The simple
                            solution to this is to describe your offerings in great detail on your website and link to this content
                            from your social media posts.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What about online Marketplaces?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Do a search on Google for “how to sell online in Nigeria” and you will be presented with
                            pages of results about selling in online marketplaces. Local online marketplaces like <span class="bold-em">Jumia</span> and
                            <span class="bold-em">Konga</span> provide an outlet for entrepreneurs to sell their products and services online. They attract
                            buyer traffic through extensive online and offline advertisements. Like social media
                            networks, these sites impose content and usage restrictions. Listing on these sites does not guarantee
                            sales performance. Some reasons for this are low seller visibility, weak user review
                            systems, price competition and faulty marketplace processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Owning your own website gives you more control over this situation. You tell your story on
                            your website and <span class="italic-em">link</span> that story to your products in the marketplace. Rather than rely on the marketplace
                            to promote your products, you drive traffic to your product pages through your marketing
                            activities on your site and on social media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are building to last, there are no shortcuts. Investing in your own website is
                            a requirement for converting prospects into customers, and customers into loyal customers.
